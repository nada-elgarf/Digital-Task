# Angular Dashboard Application

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Install Angular CLI (if not already installed)

Before running the application, make sure you have Angular CLI installed globally. If itâ€™s not installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### 2. Install Project Dependencies

After cloning or downloading the project, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

To start the Angular development server, run the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will compile and serve the application. By default, it will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### 4. Build for Production

If you want to build the application for production, use this command:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist/` folder.
